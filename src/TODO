Development Roadmap


APIs to Implement: 54 to go

Industry (8 APIs)
Killmails (3 APIs)
Location (3 APIs)
Loyalty (2 APIs)
Mail (9 APIs)
Market (11 APIs)
Planetary Interaction (4 APIs)
Skills (3 APIs)
User Iterface (5 APIs)
Wallet (6 APIs)

Models:
Need to review the request models particularly for issues and handle that gracefully

Error Codes:
Revist with the formal Swagger details, I didn't realise this was captured there

Pagination:
Look at handling more pages, currently only 1st page returns by design. Might require a refactor of a lot of APIs but I might be able to handle this as the requestHandler level with suffix approach

Caching:
See can I / should I consider caching here

Headers:
Provide more functionality to interrogage the headers would be a good thing to do. Maybe even use it to construct a header

Integration with Mock ESI data:
Currently using a mix of my own mocks and real data. ESI Mock is a project, need to look to see can I bind against that

Thourough Testing:
Gaining ESI scopes is slowing me down, I need to revisit this with real requests to look at how it handles. Concerned about any API verb that's not a GET, this might require some refactoring as no
doubt the return logic handling on things like PUT, POST and DELETE require something beyond what I have in place.

Etags:
returned in headers, check before a call. expose the tag perhaps?
V 1.0.0
Should be good to go live when all of the above are considered
